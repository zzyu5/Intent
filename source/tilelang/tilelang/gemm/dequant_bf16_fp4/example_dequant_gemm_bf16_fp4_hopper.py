    """
    Builds a parameterized TileLang/TIR matrix-multiplication kernel that dequantizes 4-bit FP inputs to BF16 on-the-fly and computes C = A @ B^T.

    This function returns a tiled, autotunable prim_func implementing a block-wise GEMM with shared-memory buffering and a pipelined K-loop. The kernel accepts:
    - A: dense input of shape (M, K) with dtype `in_dtype`.
    - B: packed quantized input of shape (N, QK) where QK = K / (8 / num_bits) stored as `uint8`.
    - C: output of shape (M, N) with dtype `out_dtype`.

    The generated kernel supports two dequantization paths:
    - fast_dequant (fast_dequant=True): calls an external mxfp dequantization intrinsic (twiddling-based) loaded from a C source returned by get_mxfp_intrin_group.
    - simple dequant (fast_dequant=False): performs a pure-TIR FP4 -> BF16 conversion per element.

    Important behavior and requirements:
    - num_bits (default 4) is the bit-width of the quantized elements; storage_dtype is uint8 and num_elems_per_byte = 8 // num_bits.
    - QK = K // num_elems_per_byte and Block_QK = block_K // num_elems_per_byte determine B and shared-buffer shapes.
    - Asserts that K % (block_K * split) == 0; K must be divisible by block_K * split for the tiling to be valid.
    - When fast_dequant is True, a valid mxfp intrinsic group (C source and function name) must be available via quantize.get_mxfp_intrin_group.
    - The kernel launches a 2D grid over ceildiv(N, block_N) and ceildiv(M, block_M) and uses `threads` threads per block with `num_stages` pipeline stages.

    Parameters that alter kernel layout/behavior (brief):
    - block_M, block_N, block_K: tile sizes for M, N, and K dimensions.
    - num_stages: number of software pipeline stages for the K-loop.
    - threads: number of threads used per kernel block.
    - split: extra K-splitting factor; K must be divisible by block_K * split.
    - source_format, num_bits: describe the quantized data layout passed to the mxfp intrinsics.

        - The macro is optimized for block-wise, per-thread transactions sized to the target storage width (uses a MAX_TRANSACTION_SIZE_BITS constant) and uses local/register buffers sized accordingly.
        - The macro uses `T.import_source` to bring the external plugin into the module and `T.call_extern` to perform the high-throughput dequantization; callers must ensure the external function matches the expected calling convention and memory layout.

    Compute a reference BF16 matrix multiply using a simple (non-twiddled) dequantization of qB.

    Converts the quantized tensor `qB` to full-precision values via `torch_convert`, computes C = A @ B^T in float32, and casts the result to bfloat16 before returning.

    Parameters:
        A (torch.Tensor): Left input matrix with shape (M, K).
        qB (torch.Tensor): Quantized representation of the right matrix; expected to be compatible with `torch_convert` and represent a matrix whose transpose will be multiplied by A.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Resulting matrix C in bfloat16 with shape (M, N).

    """
    Run and benchmark the tiled, optionally autotuned FP4->BF16 GEMM kernel and validate results against a PyTorch reference.

    This function builds a matmul kernel (either with autotuning or fixed tiling), obtains a profiler, validates numerical correctness against the appropriate reference implementation (bit-twiddled fast dequantization or simple dequantization), and runs a benchmark that prints measured latency (ms) and effective TFLOPs.

    Parameters:
        m (int): Number of rows of A and output C (default 256).
        n (int): Number of columns of B and output C (default 256).
        k (int): Inner dimension (columns of A, rows of B) (default 256).
        fast_dequant (bool): If True use the fast twiddling dequantization path and validate against the twiddling reference; otherwise use the simple dequant path (default True).
        tune (bool): If True build the kernel with autotuning configurations; if False use a fixed tiling and threading configuration for reproducible benchmarking (default False).

    Side effects:
        - Prints latency and TFLOPs to stdout.
        - Raises an assertion via the profiler if the kernel's outputs do not match the chosen reference within the tolerances (rtol=0.01, atol=0.01).
